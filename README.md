## About Me

I'm Dion Wilson -- an entrepreneur, certified personal trainer, performance coach, and dedicated Bitcoin advocate based in New York City.

I founded **Bitcoin For The Arts, Inc** to bridge the gap between the creative community and the Bitcoin economy. I run **DBody**, a performance coaching practice that serves professional and pre-professional dancers with elite strength and conditioning programs. And I host a **Bitcoin meetup** to bring together builders, artists, and curious minds around the principles of sound money and financial sovereignty.

Everything I do comes back to one belief: **empowering people to take control of their bodies, their craft, and their financial future.**

## Bitcoin Meetup

I host a regular **Bitcoin meetup** focused on education, community, and the principles that make Bitcoin the most important technology of our generation. Whether you're a beginner stacking your first sats or a seasoned Bitcoiner, you're welcome at the table.

**Topics we cover:**
- Bitcoin fundamentals and self-custody
- The case for a Bitcoin standard
- Lightning Network and real-world adoption
- Bitcoin and the creator economy
- Financial sovereignty for artists and entrepreneurs

> *"Fix the money, fix the world."*

## My Philosophy

| Pillar | Belief |
|---|---|
| **Bitcoin** | Sound money is the foundation of a free society. Bitcoin is the exit from a broken financial system. No shitcoins. |
| **Fitness** | The body is the first tool of performance. Train it with discipline, intelligence, and purpose. |
| **The Arts** | Artists deserve financial sovereignty. Bitcoin gives creators the power to own their work and their wealth. |
| **Entrepreneurship** | Build things that matter. Serve your community. Stay sovereign. |
