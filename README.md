## About Me

I'm Dion Wilson -- an entrepreneur, certified personal trainer, performance coach, and dedicated Bitcoin advocate based in New York City.

Before I ever picked up a kettlebell or stacked a sat, I spent **15+ years as a professional dancer**, performing with some of the most respected companies in the world:

- **Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater**
- **Dance Theatre of Harlem**
- **Disney's The Lion King** -- Broadway National Tour

That career taught me discipline, precision, and what it means to push a body to the edge of its potential. Today I bring all of that into everything I build.

I founded **Bitcoin For The Arts, Inc** to bridge the gap between the creative community and the Bitcoin economy. I run **DBody**, a performance coaching practice that serves professional and pre-professional dancers with elite strength and conditioning programs. And I'm deeply embedded in the **New York City Bitcoin community** -- hosting meetups, organizing walks, and helping build the communities that are bringing sound money to the streets.

Everything I do comes back to one belief: **empowering people to take control of their bodies, their craft, and their financial future.**

## NYC Bitcoin Community

I don't just talk about Bitcoin -- I'm on the ground building the community. New York City is one of the most important Bitcoin cities in the world, and I'm proud to play a role in making it stronger.

### What I'm Involved In

| Role | Community |
|---|---|
| **Host** | [**Bitcoin w/Coffee**](https://bitcoinwalk.org/nyc/) -- A regular Bitcoin meetup bringing together Bitcoiners over conversation and coffee |
| **NYC Organizer** | [**BitcoinWalk.org**](https://bitcoinwalk.org/nyc/) -- Organizing the New York City chapter of the global Bitcoin Walk movement |
| **Community Manager** | [**Harlem Bitcoin Community**](https://harlembitcoin.com/) -- Helping manage and grow Bitcoin adoption in Harlem |
| **Advocate** | **Club Orange App** -- Actively promoting and supporting the Club Orange platform to connect Bitcoiners |
| **Supporter** | **NYC-area Bitcoin meetups** -- From Jersey City to Brooklyn to Long Island, showing up and supporting every community building around sound money |

I believe the strength of Bitcoin is in its people. Every meetup, every walk, every conversation over coffee is another step toward a Bitcoin standard.

> *"Fix the money, fix the world."*

<br/>

## Professional Dance Career

Before entrepreneurship and Bitcoin, I spent 15+ years on some of the biggest stages in the world. That career shaped everything I am today -- the discipline, the work ethic, the understanding of what a body can do when it's trained with purpose.

| Company | Role |
|---|---|
| **Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater** | Professional Dancer |
| **Dance Theatre of Harlem** | Professional Dancer |
| **Disney's The Lion King** | Broadway National Tour |

This experience is the foundation of DBody. I know what it takes to perform at the highest level, and I bring that knowledge to every dancer and athlete I train.

<br/>

## My Philosophy

| Pillar | Belief |
|---|---|
| **Bitcoin** | Sound money is the foundation of a free society. Bitcoin is the exit from a broken financial system. No shitcoins. |
| **Fitness** | The body is the first tool of performance. Train it with discipline, intelligence, and purpose. |
| **The Arts** | Artists deserve financial sovereignty. Bitcoin gives creators the power to own their work and their wealth. |
| **Community** | Show up. Build locally. Support every meetup, every walk, every conversation that moves Bitcoin forward. |
| **Entrepreneurship** | Build things that matter. Serve your community. Stay sovereign. |
