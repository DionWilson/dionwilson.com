            <h2>Meet Dion Wilson</h2>
            <p>
              I spent <strong>15+ years as a professional dancer</strong>,
              performing with some of the most respected companies in the world --
              <strong>Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater</strong>,
              <strong>Dance Theatre of Harlem</strong>, and
              <strong>Disney's The Lion King</strong> on the Broadway National
              Tour. That career taught me discipline, precision, and what it takes
              to push a body to its absolute limit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today I channel all of that into three things. As the
              <strong>Founder of Bitcoin For The Arts, Inc</strong>, I'm bridging
              the gap between the creative community and the Bitcoin economy.
              Through <strong>DBody</strong>, I deliver elite strength and
              conditioning programs for professional and pre-professional dancers.
              And as the host of <strong>Bitcoin w/Coffee</strong>, NYC organizer
              for <strong>BitcoinWalk.org</strong>, and a manager of the
              <strong>Harlem Bitcoin Community</strong>, I'm building the local
              infrastructure of a Bitcoin future -- one meetup, one walk, one
              conversation at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the stage to the gym to the Bitcoin meetup, everything I do
              is about discipline, sovereignty, and building for the long term.

            <h2>NYC Bitcoin Community</h2>
            <p>
              I don't just talk about Bitcoin -- I'm on the ground building the
              community. New York City is one of the most important Bitcoin cities
              in the world, and I'm proud to play a role in making it stronger.
              From Jersey City to Brooklyn to Long Island, I show up and support
              every community building around sound money.

                The meetup I host. A regular gathering for Bitcoiners, builders,
                artists, and curious minds. Good coffee, great conversation, and
                the principles that make Bitcoin the most important technology of
                our generation.
